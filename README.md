## Name
Room

## Description
Create your clients in a minute

## Installation
`go get -u github.com/WEG-Technology/room`

## Usage
There are many examples in examples folder go look for it.

Firstly, we need three files to start wrapping our client. Which are `connection.go`, `requests.go`, `responses.go`.
Finally, `room.go` which is the core wrap of your client.

#### Connection
We are going to wrap our base connection struct to get its skills.

#### Requests
All of your request should implement IRequest.

#### Responses
The responses literarily is a DTO of your response of your endpoint.

#### Room
Your client wrapper should implement IRoom. You can implement your custom interfaces by wrapping base Room struct.

There is an example of this explanation in `./examples/room_example`
